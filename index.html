<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><code>rmapzen</code> is a client for the Mapzen API. For more information, see <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/" class="uri">https://mapzen.com/documentation/</a>. The project is <a href="https://github.com/tarakc02/rmapzen">available on github</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="search" class="section level2">
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>All of the services in <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/">Mapzen search</a> have been implemented. Search functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mz_search</code></li>
<li><code>mz_reverse_geocode</code></li>
<li><code>mz_autocomplete</code></li>
<li><code>mz_place</code></li>
<li><code>mz_structured_search</code> (<a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/structured-geocoding/">what’s this?</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to search for Hard Rock Cafes in Sweden (see <a href="#additional-convenience-features">Additional convenience features</a> below for more ways to get the correct ISO-3166 country code):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rmapzen)

hard_rock &lt;- mz_search(&quot;Hard Rock Cafe&quot;, boundary.country = &quot;SE&quot;)
hard_rock</code></pre>
<pre><code>## GeoJSON response from Mapzen
## Attribution info: https://search.mapzen.com/v1/attribution 
## Bounds (lon/lat): (11.84, 55.78) - (18.08, 62.39)
## 10 locations:
##    Hard Rock Café (18.05, 59.34)
##    Hard Rock Cafe (11.97, 57.7)
##    Rock&#39;n Roll Café (13.83, 55.93)
##    Cafe Charm (17.3, 62.39)
##    Cafe capri (17.95, 59.4)
##   ...</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, <code>mz_geocode</code> is a convenient function to geocode an address, utilizing the more general <code>mz_search</code> function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mz_geocode(&quot;UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 4
##                  geocode_address geocode_longitude geocode_latitude
## *                          &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA         -122.2542         37.87238

<h2>Isochrones</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/mobility/isochrone/api-reference/">isochrone service</a> allows you to “[compute] areas that are reachable within specified time intervals from a location, and returns the reachable regions as contours of polygons or lines that you can display on a map”. Below is an example of finding places within driving distance of UC Berkeley, and plotting them using the <a href="http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/">leaflet package</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ucb &lt;- mz_geocode(&quot;UC Berkeley&quot;)

    costing_model = mz_costing$auto(),
    contours = mz_contours(c(10, 20, 30)),

<h2>Vector tile service</h2>
<p><code>rmapzen</code> provides an interface to Mapzen’s <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/vector-tiles/">vector tiles service</a>. Tile requests can be specified using the x, y, zoom coordinates of the tile service, as well as with a lat/long bounding box. For instance, continuing the previous example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)

# mz_bbox is a generic that returns the bounding box of an object
ucb_tiles &lt;- mz_vector_tiles(mz_bbox(isos))

# vector tiles return all layers (roads, water, buildings, etc) in a list
roads &lt;- as_sf(ucb_tiles$roads) %&gt;% filter(kind != &quot;ferry&quot;)
water &lt;- as_sf(ucb_tiles$water)

# make a quick static map that includes roads and oceans as reference
ggplot() +
    geom_sf(data = water, 
            fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;, colour = NA) + 
    geom_sf(data = roads, 
            size = .2, colour = &quot;gray30&quot;) + 
    geom_sf(data = as_sf(isos),

<h2><code>sf</code> and <code>Spatial*DataFrame</code> conversion</h2>
<p>As some of the above examples illustrate, any object returned by a Mapzen service can be converted to the appropriate <code>Spatial*DataFrame</code> or <code>sf</code> object using the generics <code>as_sp</code> and <code>as_sf</code>, for easy interoperability with other packages. You can also convert most objects directly to data frames, allowing for use within tidy pipelines:</p>

<h2>Convenience features</h2>
<p>Several of the search functions take, optionally, the arguments <code>layers</code>, <code>sources</code>, and <code>boundary.country</code> (the latter requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166">ISO-3166</a> codes). If you’re using an IDE with auto-complete, the objects <code>mz_layers</code>, <code>mz_sources</code>, and <code>mz_countries</code> should make it easier to get the correct codes.</p>

<p>Similarly, argument constructors are available for easier specifications of isochrone and search requests.</p>

<li><code>mz_costing</code></li>

<p>The package does not yet support <a href="https://mapzen.com/documentation/">other Mapzen API services</a>. But do check out these related R packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr">elevatr</a> for accessing elevation data, including Mapzen Terrain and Elevation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Ironholds/poster">postr</a> for address parsing and normalization using the <a href="https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal">libpostal</a> library</li>

<div id="installation" class="section level2">
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;tarakc02/rmapzen&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>You’ll also need to <a href="https://mapzen.com/developers">acquire an API key</a>, and then set the <code>MAPZEN_KEY</code> environment variable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Sys.setenv(MAPZEN_KEY = &quot;mapzen-xxxxxx&quot;)</code></pre>
