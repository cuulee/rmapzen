## Introduction

`rmapzen` is a client for the Mapzen API. For more information, see [https://mapzen.com/documentation/](https://mapzen.com/documentation/). The project is [available on github](https://github.com/tarakc02/rmapzen). 

## Search

All of the services in [Mapzen search](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/) have been implemented. Search functions:

* `mz_search`
* `mz_reverse_geocode`
* `mz_autocomplete`
* `mz_place`
* `mz_structured_search` ([what's this?](https://mapzen.com/documentation/search/structured-geocoding/))

For example, to search for Hard Rock Cafes in Sweden (see [Additional convenience features](#additional-convenience-features) below for more ways to get the correct ISO-3166 country code):

```{r loadmapzen, echo = FALSE}
library(rmapzen)
```

```{r ex-search-2, cache = TRUE}
library(rmapzen)

hard_rock <- mz_search("Hard Rock Cafe", boundary.country = "SE")
hard_rock
```

Additionally, `mz_geocode` is a convenient function to geocode an address, utilizing the more general `mz_search` function.

```{r ex-geocode, cache = TRUE}
mz_geocode("UC Berkeley, Berkeley, CA")
```

## Isochrones

The [isochrone service](https://mapzen.com/documentation/mobility/isochrone/api-reference/) allows you to "[compute] areas that are reachable within specified time intervals from a location, and returns the reachable regions as contours of polygons or lines that you can display on a map". Below is an example of finding places within driving distance of UC Berkeley, and plotting them using the [leaflet package](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

```{r load-leaflet, echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r isochrone-example, cache = TRUE}
ucb <- mz_geocode("UC Berkeley")
isos <- mz_isochrone(
    ucb,
    costing_model = mz_costing$auto(),
    contours = mz_contours(c(10, 20, 30))
)

library(leaflet)
leaflet(as_sp(isos)) %>%
    addProviderTiles("CartoDB.DarkMatter") %>%
    addPolygons(color = ~paste0("#", color), weight = 1) %>%
    addLegend(colors = ~paste0("#", color), 
              labels = ~paste(contour, "minutes"),
              title = "Drive times from <br/> UC Berkeley Campus")
```

## Vector tile service

`rmapzen` provides an interface to Mapzen's [vector tiles service](https://mapzen.com/documentation/vector-tiles/). Tile requests can be specified using the x, y, zoom coordinates of the tile service, as well as with a lat/long bounding box. For instance, continuing the previous example:

```{r vector-tile-example, cache = TRUE}
# mz_bbox is a generic that returns the bounding box of an object
ucb_tiles <- mz_vector_tiles(mz_bbox(isos))

# vector tiles return all layers (roads, water, buildings, etc) in a list
roads <- as_sp(ucb_tiles$roads)
roads <- subset(roads, kind != "ferry")

# some layers contain multiple geometry types (points, lines, polygons)
# but Spatial*DataFrames can only contain a single type
water <- as_sp(ucb_tiles$water, geometry_type = "polygon")
water <- subset(water, kind == "ocean")

# make a quick static map that includes roads and oceans as reference
library(ggplot2)
water_df <- fortify(water)
roads_df <- fortify(roads) 

ggplot(roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
    coord_quickmap() +
    theme_void() +

    # add ocean
    geom_polygon(data = water_df, colour = NA, fill = "lightblue") +
    
    # add the road network
    geom_path(size = .2, colour = "gray30") +
    
    # add the isochrones
    geom_polygon(data = as.data.frame(isos),
                 aes(x = lon, y = lat, group = contour),
                 colour = NA, fill = "black", alpha = .3)
```

## Tidiness/Interoperability

As some of the above examples illustrate, any object returned by a Mapzen service can be converted to the appropriate Spatial* object using the generic function `as_sp`, for easy interoperability with other packages. You can also convert most objects directly to data frames, allowing for use within tidy pipelines:

```{r ex-tidy, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
as.data.frame(hard_rock) %>%
    select(name, confidence, region, locality, neighbourhood)
```

## Mapzen list methods

Currently, the following methods are available to pull out commonly used 
pieces of a response:

* `mz_coordinates` (only available for search results)
* `mz_bbox`

```{r ex-accessors, cache = TRUE}
mz_coordinates(hard_rock)
mz_bbox(ucb_tiles)
```

## A more detailed example

Say you have an afternoon meeting at the TransAmerica center in San Francisco, and would like to visit a local museum afterwards. Here's how to make a map of museums within walking distance:

```{r detailed-example, cache = TRUE}
# first geocode the TransAmerica Center
trans_america <- mz_geocode("TransAmerica Center, San Francisco CA")

# then identify the area that is within 15 minutes walking distance
walkable <- mz_isochrone(
    trans_america,
    costing_model = mz_costing$pedestrian(),
    contours = mz_contours(15))

# now search for museums, but limit the search to areas within "walkable"
museums <- mz_search(
    "Museum", 
    boundary.rect = mz_bbox(walkable), 
    layers = mz_layers$venue, 
    size = 15
)

# use the leaflet package to draw the map
leaflet(as_sp(walkable)) %>%
    addProviderTiles("CartoDB.DarkMatter") %>%
    addPolygons(color = "#ffffff", weight = 1) %>%
    addMarkers(
        data = trans_america, 
        lat = ~geocode_latitude, 
        lng = ~geocode_longitude,
        popup = "TransAmerica Center") %>%
    addCircleMarkers(
        data = as_sp(museums), 
        weight = 1,
        radius = 7,
        opacity = 1,
        popup = ~name,
        color = "#ff0000")
```

## Rate limits

Mapzen's per-second [published rate limits](https://mapzen.com/documentation/overview/#search-and-mobility-products) are automatically observed, using the [ratelimitr package](https://github.com/tarakc02/ratelimitr). The package does not manage daily limits for you, but you can check usage statistics at any time using the function `mz_check_usage`.

```{r mz-check-usage, cache = TRUE}
mz_check_usage()
```

These statistics are taken from the headers in the various responses from Mapzen and stored only for the length of the R session. If an endpoint has "No data," that means you have yet to use that endpoint during the current R  session, or that all uses of the endpoint have hit Mapzen's cache servers and so have not been counted against usage limits.

## Convenience features

Several of the search functions take, optionally, the arguments `layers`, `sources`, and `boundary.country` (the latter requires [ISO-3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166) codes). If you're using an IDE with auto-complete, the objects `mz_layers`, `mz_sources`, and `mz_countries` should make it easier to get the correct codes.

![Easy lookup for ISO-3166 codes](fig/mz-countries.png)

Similarly, argument constructors are available for easier specifications of isochrone and search requests.

* `mz_costing` 
* `mz_costing_options` 
* `mz_location`
* `mz_contours`
* `mz_date_time`

## Related projects

The package does not yet support [other Mapzen API services](https://mapzen.com/documentation/). But do check out these related R packages:

* [elevatr](https://github.com/jhollist/elevatr) for accessing elevation data, including Mapzen Terrain and Elevation
* [postr](https://github.com/Ironholds/poster) for address parsing and normalization using the [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) library

## Installation

This is a very young package, things may break or change. To install:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("tarakc02/rmapzen")
```

You'll also need to [acquire an API key](https://mapzen.com/developers), and then set the `MAPZEN_KEY` environment variable:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Sys.setenv(MAPZEN_KEY = "mapzen-xxxxxx")
```
